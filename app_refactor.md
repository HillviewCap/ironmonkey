# Refactoring Plan for app.py

Based on the conventions outlined in CONVENTIONS.md, here's a strategy to refactor app.py:

1. Reorganize Imports:
   - Group imports by standard library, third-party, and local modules
   - Use absolute imports for local modules

2. Application Factory:
   - Move the create_app function to the top of the file
   - Simplify the create_app function by breaking it down into smaller functions

3. Configuration:
   - Move configuration logic to a separate function

4. Database Setup:
   - Move database initialization to a separate function

5. Authentication:
   - Move authentication-related routes to a separate blueprint

6. Error Handling:
   - Create a dedicated error handling module

7. Blueprints:
   - Move route definitions to appropriate blueprints
   - Register blueprints in the create_app function

8. Models:
   - Ensure all database models are in the models directory

9. Utilities:
   - Move utility functions to a separate utils module

10. API Routes:
    - Move API-related routes to the api blueprint

11. Scheduler:
    - Move scheduler setup to a separate function

12. Environment Variables:
    - Use a consistent method for accessing environment variables

13. Logging:
    - Implement consistent logging throughout the application

14. Type Hints:
    - Add type hints to all functions and methods

15. Docstrings:
    - Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules

16. Constants:
    - Define constants at the module level

17. Main Execution:
    - Simplify the main execution block

This refactoring plan will help organize the code according to the conventions, improve modularity, and enhance maintainability.
