# Template Organization Suggestions

Based on the current structure of your templates, here's a suggested organization to improve maintainability and clarity:

1. Create subdirectories for specific areas of functionality:
   - admin/
   - auth/
   - main/
   - errors/

2. Move templates to their respective directories:
   - admin/
     - admin.html
     - parsed_content.html
     - rss_feeds.html
     - users.html
   - auth/
     - login.html
     - register.html
   - main/
     - index.html
     - parsed_content.html
     - rss_manager.html
     - search.html
     - view_item.html
   - errors/
     - 500.html

3. Keep shared templates in the root templates/ directory:
   - base.html
   - edit_parsed_content.html
   - edit_rss_feed.html

4. Create a shared/ directory for reusable components:
   - shared/
     - flash_messages.html
     - scripts.html

5. Consider creating a layout/ directory for base templates:
   - layout/
     - base.html (move from root)

This organization will make it easier to locate specific templates and separate concerns. You may need to update your Flask routes to reflect these new template locations.

Next steps:
1. Review this suggested structure
2. If approved, create the new directories
3. Move the template files to their new locations
4. Update Flask routes to use the new template paths
5. Test thoroughly to ensure all templates are still accessible
