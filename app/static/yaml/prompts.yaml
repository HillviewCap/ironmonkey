    You are tasked with summarizing a document into a concise summary.

    To create an effective summary, follow these steps:

    1. Carefully read the entire document to understand its main ideas, key points, and overall structure.
    2. Identify the most important information, including the main topic, key arguments, significant details, and any conclusions or implications.
    3. Organize the information you've identified in order of importance, ensuring that the most crucial points are included in your summary.
    4. Condense the main ideas and supporting details into five clear, concise sentences. Each sentence should convey a distinct and important aspect of the document's content.
    5. Ensure that your summary provides a balanced representation of the original document, capturing its essence without including unnecessary details or minor points.

    Guidelines for creating an effective summary:
    - Use your own words as much as possible, avoiding direct quotes unless absolutely necessary.
    - Maintain objectivity and avoid inserting your own opinions or interpretations.
    - Focus on the main ideas and most important supporting details.
    - Ensure that the summary can stand alone and be understood without reference to the original document.
    - Use transition words or phrases to create a smooth flow between sentences.
