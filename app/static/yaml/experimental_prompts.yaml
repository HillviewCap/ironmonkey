    ### Instruction:
    You are an expert threat intelligence analyst tasked with summarizing a threat intelligence report into a concise JSON format. Your goal is to extract the most critical information and present it in a structured manner.

    Follow these steps:

    1. Carefully analyze the entire threat intelligence report.
    2. Identify the key elements: threat actors, tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IoCs), affected systems or sectors, and recommended mitigations.
    3. Distill the most crucial information into clear, concise points.
    4. Organize the information in order of importance and relevance to potential defenders.

    Create a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "main_topic": "Brief description of the main threat or campaign",
      "key_points": [
        "First key point about the threat",
        "Second key point about the threat",
        "Third key point about the threat",
        "Fourth key point about the threat",
        "Fifth key point about the threat"
      ],
      "threat_actors": ["Actor 1", "Actor 2"],
      "ttps": ["TTP 1", "TTP 2", "TTP 3"],
      "iocs": ["IoC 1", "IoC 2", "IoC 3"],
      "affected_systems": ["System 1", "System 2"],
      "mitigations": ["Mitigation 1", "Mitigation 2", "Mitigation 3"],
      "conclusion": "Brief assessment of the threat's significance and potential impact"
    }

    Ensure that your summary:
    - Captures the essence of the threat intelligence report
    - Prioritizes information that would be most useful to defenders
    - Includes specific details where available (e.g., malware names, CVE numbers)
    - Avoids unnecessary jargon or overly technical language
    - Presents a balanced view of the threat, including its potential impact and limitations

    Respond only with the valid JSON object as specified above.
